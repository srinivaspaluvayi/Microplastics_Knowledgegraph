        "Abstract": " The pervasive presence and enduring existence of micro and nanoplastics in the environment render their exposure to humans and aquatic creatures unavoidable. Research indicates these tiny plastic particles can be taken in by aquatic beings and mammals. Once within the body, micro and nanoplastics have the capability to infiltrate the brain, although the level of penetration and the subsequent neurotoxic effects are not fully explored. Previous studies indicate that metal (oxide) nanoparticles can enter the brain and induce neurotoxic effects. Given the chemical resemblances between plastic particles and inert metal (oxide) nanoparticles, this review aims to summarize existing studies on the neurotoxic implications of nanoplastics across various species and in vitro settings. The current evidence, although incomplete, suggests that exposure to nanoplastics may lead to oxidative stress, potentially causing cell damage and raising the risk of developing neurological disorders. Moreover, such exposure could inhibit acetylcholinesterase activity and alter neurotransmitter levels, potentially contributing to observed behavioral changes. There is a notable lack of systematic comparison regarding the neurotoxic effects stemming from different particle types, shapes, and sizes at various concentrations and durations of exposure. Understanding these aspects is essential for further evaluating the neurotoxic danger and risk associated with nanoplastics.",
        "Introduction": "1.\n            Introduction\n            Plastics are crucial in producing various products, including packaging materials, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, textiles, masks, and surgical instruments [1,2,3]. Their widespread application can be attributed to their adaptability, strength, water resistance, cost-effectiveness, and ease of production with minimal energy use [1,2]. These attributes make plastics an excellent choice for fabricating medical devices such as syringes, IV bags, medical packaging, artificial joints, and prosthetics, as well as food storage solutions and other plastic goods [4]. Despite these benefits, plastics face criticism due to environmental and health concerns stemming from their long-lasting nature, widespread presence, and potential to contaminate food and water sources for animals [1,4]. Plastics gained traction alongside the Industrial Revolution, expanding significantly as a consumer product since the 1930s and 1940s. Between 1975 and 2012, global plastic resin production jumped by 620%, reaching 288 million tons [5]. Consequently, plastic waste surged from 275 million tons in 2010 to 335 million tons by 2017 [5,6], posing a grave threat to human health due to its largely unsustainable usage patterns [4]. In the U.S., the recycling rate for plastics is merely 8.8% [7]. Plastics' slow decomposition remains problematic, as single-use plastics like LDPE bags may take up to 250 years to break down in landfills or natural environments [8]. By 2025, it is expected that 192 countries' coasts within 50 km will accumulate around 250 million tons of poorly managed marine plastic waste [5]. Over time, these enduring plastics fragment into microplastics and nanoplastics-tiny particles with variable chemical structures formed through degradation processes [9,10,11]. Microplastics and nanoplastics, present everywhere, from the atmosphere to aquatic systems, pose threats due to their minute size and diverse shapes, including fibers, foams, beads, and fragments [12]. Interestingly, spherical microplastics may cause fewer gut health issues than irregular ones [13]. Although there is debate over the size categories of plastic debris, classifications typically include macroplastics (2.5-100 cm), mesoplastics (0.1-2.5 cm), microplastics (1000 μm-1 µm), and nanoplastics (<1 µm) [14,15,16], with some sources defining micro- and nanoplastics as slightly different ranges \"small microplastics\" (1 µm to <100 µm), \"sub-micron plastics\" (100 nm - <1 µm), \"nanoplastics\" (1 nm to <100 nm) [17,18], or 100 nm-1 nm [19,20]. However, there is a significant gap in understanding regarding the dimensions, architecture, and cost of micro- and nanoplastics. The toxicological impacts of micro- and nanoplastics on human organs, their cellular absorption pathways, and the underlying molecular mechanisms remain underexplored due to the scant and often inconsistent scientific literature. This study aims to provide an overview of the potential entry of microplastics and nanoplastics into the body and then into the brain and to link exposure and the physicochemical properties of the particles with neurological diseases. In addition, it also provides insights into the mechanisms of the effects of microplastics and nanoplastics on the diseases above.",

The review includes studies published between 2015 and 2024, ensuring that the most current findings are represented. The inclusion criteria were focused on peer-reviewed articles that involved both animal and human models and specifically examined micro and nanoplastics's effects on oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. Studies unrelated to micro and nanoplastics, those involving other pollutants classes, or those lacking molecular insights were excluded. The selected studies were synthesized to assess consistent findings on micro and nanoplastics's ability to induce oxidative stress, including the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation, as well as its endocrine-disrupting effects on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, thyroid function, and other hormonal pathways. Special attention was given to studies addressing micro and nanoplastics's persistence in the environment and their potential for cumulative toxicity through prolonged exposure.",

        "Conclusion": "11.\n            Conclusions\n            Despite the widespread presence of micro- and nanoplastics in the environment, information on their absorption and toxicity remains limited. Research shows these particles can enter various organisms, including humans, fish, and mammals, through different exposure pathways. There's a significant lack of knowledge about the neurotoxic potential of these plastics. However, studies indicate that they might induce oxidative stress, inhibit the activity of AChE, impact neurotransmitter levels, and alter behavior in some species. It's still unclear if these effects relate to neurodevelopmental or neurodegenerative disorders in humans, unlike metal nanoparticles. Most experimental exposures to date don't mimic real human exposure situations, as they occur over short periods with high doses. In contrast, humans are exposed chronically to lower levels. Moreover, many studies use particle types and shapes that are not typical of environmental conditions. There's also a significant gap in systematically comparing various particle types, shapes, sizes, and concentrations. Most research so far has concentrated on aquatic species. To thoroughly understand the neurotoxin and exposure risks from micro- and nanoplastics, several actions are necessary:\n            1. Improved Monitoring: A better assessment of exposure levels for humans is needed, focusing on different exposure routes like inhalation, ingestion, and retrograde transport after nasal exposure, along with particle characteristics.\n            2. Focused Assessments: Research should investigate absorption through the lungs, nasal epithelium, or gut, potential crossing into the bloodstream, blood-brain barrier penetration, and organ accumulation, including the brain. It must determine direct transfer to the brain via nerve endings or indirect bloodstream transport, helping to identify the most dangerous particles for human health and the most vital exposure reduction measures.\n            3. Enhanced Risk Identification: Exposure time and particle dose standardization should incorporate dose-response curves, considering particle weight and number. Research should utilize various particle types, sizes, shapes, and surface charges, preferably those prevalent in the environment. For realistic assessments, aged and contaminated particles should be studied alongside virgin manufactured particles despite the complex toxicity.\n            4. Diversified Species Use: It's crucial to include different species, particularly mammals, given the variability in exposure routes. Laboratory assays can significantly aid hazard identification, increasing throughput, reducing costs, and providing mechanistic insights. However, the focus should be on subtle, functional effects beyond overt (neuro)toxic endpoints, as such effects may occur only at unrealistic exposure levels. Ultimately, irrespective of the findings from these hazard and risk evaluations of nanoplastics, measures should be implemented to minimize their further contamination and release into the environment.",

        "Abstract": " Humans are continuously exposed to polymeric materials such as in textiles, car tires and packaging. Unfortunately, their break down products pollute our environment, leading to widespread contamination with micro- and nanoplastics (MNPs). The blood–brain barrier (BBB) is an important biological barrier that protects the brain from harmful substances. In our study we performed short term uptake studies in mice with orally administered polystyrene micro-/nanoparticles (9.55 µm, 1.14 µm, 0.293 µm). We show that nanometer sized particles—but not bigger particles—reach the brain within only 2 h after gavage. To understand the transport mechanism, we performed coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations on the interaction of DOPC bilayers with a polystyrene nanoparticle in the presence and absence of various coronae. We found that the composition of the biomolecular corona surrounding the plastic particles was critical for passage through the BBB. Cholesterol molecules enhanced the uptake of these contaminants into the membrane of the BBB, whereas the protein model inhibited it. These opposing effects could explain the passive transport of the particles into the brain.",
        "Introduction": "1. Introduction\n      Micro-/nanoplastics (MNPs) are a growing concern, both for human health and the environment, due to their widespread distribution and potential harmfulness. Humans ingest a significant amount of MNPs through their diet [1], and plastic fragments are increasingly found in body fluids and tissues, such as blood and the placenta [2,3,4]. The definition of nanoplastic is still a topic of debate and varies from a range of 1000–1 nm to 100–1 nm [5,6,7]. To mitigate the potential harm of MNPs to human health and the environment, it is critical to limit exposure and reduce their use while continuing to study their effects [1,8]. MNPs can enter the body and cross impermeable barriers such as the intestinal mucosal barrier and the blood–brain barrier. The mechanism of transport of MNPs through these barriers is a complex process that depends on several factors such as particle size, charge, surface chemistry and the type of cell with which they interact [9]. For larger particles in the µm range, transport occurs through the binding of the particle to cell surface receptors [10] and the formation of a phagocytic shell that eventually fuses with lysosomes [11]. MNPs can also enter cells by endocytosis [12], in which the cell membrane engulfs the particle and brings it into the cell without the formation of a phagosome. On the other hand, particles less than 0.5 μm in diameter can potentially cross lipid bilayers through a process known as transcytosis [13], where the particle can diffuse through the lipid bilayer and exit at its other side without being engulfed into the cell. Nanoparticles applied for medicinal purposes revealed also passage via tight junctions for sizes of around 1.4 nm [14]. Further investigations are required to determine if this is also true for nanoplastic particles. However, the success of this process depends on the thermodynamics of the phase transfer from the aqueous medium into the membrane. The relative energy of the individual states must be similar for the transfer to occur at a reasonable rate [15]. If the particle is too stabilized or destabilized in the hydrophobic environment, the transport will be hindered by a barrier.\n      Earlier simulation studies [16,17,18,19,20,21] found that when nanometer-sized polystyrene (PS) particles absorb into the hydrophobic core of lipid bilayers, the polymer chains that make up the plastic particle may disentangle and form a network of macromolecules within the membrane. This process is dependent on the polymer type and the presence of cross-links and branches in the plastic material, but it can cause severe changes in the bilayer that can have physiological consequences. The calculations suggest that the hydrophilic polymer is significantly stabilized within the hydrophobic core of the membrane. Therefore, it would not be able to cross through this biological barrier effectively. The results of these experiments, however, raise the question: how can a particle with such thermodynamic properties cross the blood–brain barrier?\n      The surface of MNPs is crucial to their behavior in the human body, as it defines interactions between the particle and its environment. MNPs form a protein corona on their surface [22] which has been shown for nanoparticles of other materials to alter their interactions and toxicity. Walczyk et al., 2010 found that the protein corona, rather than the bare material properties of the particle, greatly influences interactions with the environment [23]. This is confirmed by recent studies with MNPs indicating that the protein corona acquired by plastic particles could significantly impact uptake and toxicity, such as in zebrafish [24] and mice [25]. Thus, the history of the coronated particle affects the outcome of experiments, emphasizing the need for rigorous methodologies when investigating the physiological effects of MNPs [24,25]. It is therefore essential to understand the changes that various coronae can introduce into the MNP–biomolecular interactions, especially regarding crossing the blood–brain barrier.",
        "Methods": "2. Materials and Methods\n      \n        2.1. Materials \n        Commercially available polystyrene micro- and nanoplastic particles were purchased from microparticles GmbH (Berlin, Germany). Particles were delivered in aqueous solution without modifier and used as received. In total, 3 different sizes were used (9.55 ± 0.13 µm particles, stained in blue; 1.14 ± 0.03 µm particles stained fluorescent red Ex/Em 530 nm/607 nm; 0.293 ± 0.008 µm particles stained fluorescent green, Ex/Em 502 nm/528 nm) and mixed at equal weight concentrations of 0.3 mg/size/dose in sterile water for application in mice.\n      \n      \n        2.2. Material Characterization and Stability \n        Microparticles of 1.14 µm size were measured for their ζ-potential (mV), size distribution and polydispersity index (PDI) by means of a Zetasizer Pro (Malvern Pananalytical) and data were analyzed using ZS Xplorer software. The cuvettes were ZETASIZER Nano Series Disposable folded capillary cells (DTS1070) at 25 °C. The particles were delivered in an aqueous solution and were measured at a concentration of 0.5 mg/mL diluted in deionized water (0.55 µS), PBS and fully supplemented RPMI-1640 Media including 10% FBS and 1% L-glutamine. Deionized water, PBS and fully supplemented RPMI-1640 Media was filtered with a MILLEX-GV 0.22 µm filter to avoid particulate matter from the matrix. The 10 and 0.293 µm particles had to be excluded because the Zetasizer has a measurement range of 10–0.3 µm. For assessment of stability, MNPs of 1.14 and 0.293 nm size were incubated in simulated gastric fluid. Simulated gastric fluids were prepared as described within the U.S. Pharmacopoeia (0.16 M aq. HCl, 2 g/L NaCl and 3.2 g/L pepsin). Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h and the supernatants were measured for fluorescence at Ex/Em 530 nm/607 nm and Ex/Em 502 nm/528 nm, respectively, in a Tecan Infinite M200 Plate Reader. \n      \n      \n        2.3. In Vivo Experiments \n        In total, 6 wild-type male C57Bl/6J mice were used in this proof of principle study (n = 2/group). Animals were bred in-house and kept under standard conditions (ambient temperature at 12/12 h light/dark cycle). Food and water were provided ad libitum. Experiments were conducted according to Austrian animal welfare legislation (license 2022-0.257.045), and experimental setups were approved by the local animal ethics committee. Briefly, mice were assigned randomly to 3 treatment groups and either left untreated (ctr) or gavaged with a single dose of 100 µL of MNP mixture as described above. Control and MNP-exposed mice were euthanized after 2 h or 4 h post gavage and mouse brains were harvested and processed according to a modified isopropanol protocol [26]. \n      \n      \n        2.4. Fluorescent Microscopy Analysis \n        Three micrometer tissue sections were cut and processed according to isopropanol protocol for immunofluorescence staining. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). Images were taken at a Zeiss Axio Imager M2 microcope (63× objective). For image processing Zeiss Zen blue (version 3.5) was used.\n      \n      \n        2.5. Molecular Dynamics Simulations \n        We chose 1,2-Dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) as a model lipid; it is a predominant phospholipid in the human body, which has also been used extensively in simple and effective models for the blood–brain barrier [27]. The 2704 DOPC molecules in each membrane leaflet gave a 43.16 nm × 43.16 nm bilayer. The nanoplastic investigated here contained 4 chains of polystyrene, each with 100 styrene monomer units, folded together into a ca. 5 nm nanoparticle through a simulated annealing approach described elsewhere [28]. The effect of the particle size was not investigated here, as it has been demonstrated before that the absorption of the plastic nanoparticles into membranes was exothermic regardless of the size, i.e., qualitatively highly similar, although quantitatively the absorption energy changed [21]. It is reasonable to assume that this statement is valid unless the mechanism of the transfer through the bilayer changes to transcytosis, which happens at a much larger size threshold, at ca. 500 nm, beyond which point the absorption of the particle into the bilayer does not occur. Since in the present study only the direction of the absorption into the membrane will be discussed, as well as trends, and not the exact energetics, tracking the consequences of particle sizes is unnecessary.\n        The simulation boxes were generated by employing PACKMOL 20.10. [29,30]. Applying previously established coarse-grained models for the components of the system within the framework of the MARTINI force field [19,31], we used the GROMACS program package version 2020.3 for the simulations and the subsequent analysis [32,33,34,35,36]. The plastic particle was steered from the bulk of the liquid into the hydrophobic core of the membrane through umbrella sampling [37]. In this process, the membrane–plastic system was simulated in water, with the distance of the plastic to the lipid bilayer set to a defined value via an external harmonic potential. By repeating the simulations at different distances, the free energy profile of the phase transfer can be obtained using the weighted histogram analysis method (WHAM) [37,38]. The timestep in the simulations was set to 10 fs. Each system underwent a 60 ns equilibration in the NpT ensemble with a semi-isotropic Berendsen barostat set to 1 bar and a velocity rescale thermostat set to 310 K. The 40 ns production run was conducted at 310 K in an NVT ensemble. The same settings were used for the unbiased simulations, but the production run was conducted for 1 μs.",
        "Methodology": "",
        "Results": "3. Results and Discussion\n      Polystyrene is a commonly used model plastic for studying the transfer of nanoplastic particles through membranes due to its widespread use and high environmental pollution levels, potentially leading to high exposure to the fragments. The size of the nanoparticles in the modeling part of this study was chosen to be ca. 5 nm, and a well-established coarse-grained model of PS was selected to make the calculations more efficient, along with a matching force field for the biomolecules in the system. For simulating the transfer of the plastics through the blood–brain barrier, DOPC bilayers were selected as a model membrane. In total, 4 models were used to study the role of the corona in the transfer: (1) pristine plastic, (2) a particle with a corona made of 100 cholesterol molecules, (3) a particle with a corona made of 150 cholesterol molecules and (4) a particle with a corona made of 40 protein molecules. Through these models, the importance of the corona in the transfer of the PS particle through the blood–brain barrier can be addressed. Protein coronae have been observed in experiments with various proteins, including human serum albumin [22,39]. Since in an earlier study we found that tryptophan has a large affinity to plastics in aqueous solutions [40], we chose a small protein featuring several of these amino acids to model the protein corona (PDB ID: 1LE1).\n      The analysis suggests a strong interaction between the coronated plastic particle and its corona in the aqueous phase. This is evident from the swelling of the polymer chains in the presence of protein or cholesterol molecules, which is more extensive for the thicker corona of 150 cholesterol molecules (see the radius of gyration Rg values in Figure 1 in the first 200 ns). This swelling occurs because the non-polar molecules in the corona penetrate the plastic chains, leading to an increase in the surface and volume of the particle. The same effect can also be observed from the shrinking of the protein corona. Initial simulations showed striking differences, with pristine and protein-coronated plastic particles not entering the membrane within 1 μs. At the same time, those with cholesterol transferred spontaneously into the hydrophobic core of the membrane (Figure 1).\n      The mechanism for facilitating particle transfer was also identified in the two cholesterol simulations. The polar groups of cholesterol interacted with the DOPC in the membrane, resulting in a stable close contact as the coronated particle approached the bilayer (Figure 2). The interaction is amplified by the deformation of the lipid bilayer, forming a bulge towards the cholesterol corona molecules. As a result of this bulge, the closer lipid leaflet becomes looser, creating enough space for the cholesterol and plastic to diffuse into the membrane. The DOPC molecules rearrange to point their hydrophobic tails towards the incoming hydrophobic particles, leading to gradual encapsulation of the plastic by the hydrophobic tails. In contrast, the cholesterol molecules dissociate from the polymer and disperse in the lipid bilayer (Figure 2). Once the nanoplastic enters the hydrophobic core of the membrane, it is entirely surrounded and covered by lipids, leading to its slow dissolution and disentanglement of chains in the lipid bilayer, as previously observed. The behavior is dependent on the cross-links between polymer chains, as discussed in earlier studies. However, the membrane with the plastic in its hydrophobic core still retains some overall structure despite significant, potentially pathologically harmful differences compared to the neat bilayer. In the next set of simulations, the thermodynamics of the phase transfer process were calculated by steering the plastic particle into the membrane using umbrella sampling. For the pristine particle, an energy gain of −138 kJ/mol was found, in good qualitative agreement with previous data [39]. We found that the particle with the thinner cholesterol corona had a similarly exergonic phase transfer (−132 kJ/mol) to the pristine plastic, still with more cholesterol molecules, the driving force increased, exhibiting a free energy drop of −203 kJ/mol upon absorption into the membrane. In other words, the plastic without a corona or with a cholesterol corona can easily enter the blood–brain barrier but cannot exit it and thus cannot enter the neural tissue. In agreement, Notman and coworkers found that the entry of a pristine polystyrene nanoparticle into a DPPC membrane becomes more exothermic when cholesterol is present in the lipid bilayer [21]. The authors suggested that the reason for this finding may be that the cholesterol–polystyrene interplay is stronger than the DPPC–polystyrene interactions, although they also pointed out that the plastic does not seem to separate the cholesterol from the phospholipids. Our results here also suggest that there are more complicated effects at play, since cholesterol is in interaction with the polystyrene already before entering the membrane, thus—if it would come down only to the strength of the interactions—no increase in absorption energy should be observed.\n      Interestingly, for the plastic with a protein corona, the energy demand for entry was too high (+218 kJ/mol), indicating that it cannot enter the blood–brain barrier at all. The corona on the surface of the plastic apparently affects its thermodynamics for diffusion into the membrane. Therefore, it seems feasible that with the right combination of molecules, it can allow for the plastic to be absorbed into the membrane and cross over to the neural tissue. \n      To underline these computational findings of MNP uptake into the brain, we performed short-term exposure experiments in mice with commercially available PS particles of 3 different sizes (9.55 µm, stained in blue; 1.14 µm particles stained fluorescent red Ex/Em 530 nm/607 nm; 0.293 µm particles stained fluorescent green, Ex/Em 502 nm/528 nm). The microplastic particles of the size 1.14 µm were characterized for their ζ-potential, average size and polydispersity index (PDI) in aqueous solution, PBS and fully supplemented cell culture media (Table 1). A similar trend of decreasing ζ-potential and increasing size and PDI were observed with increasing salt and component concentration within the matrix. The increased size is caused by the build-up of the protein corona in fully supplemented media. To test the stability of the MNPs, the particles were incubated in simulated gastric fluid to identify potential to leach out of the fluorophore at 37 °C for 24 h. No fluorescent signal was detected in the supernatant after the indicated time range. This result is in accordance with previously published leaching experiments [41].\n      For animal experiments, we administered MNP PS particle mixtures of 3 different sizes via oral gavage to wild-type mice and examined whether the particles can cross the BBB. To our surprise, we found specific nanometer-sized green fluorescent signals in the brain tissue of MNP-exposed mice after only 2 h, indicating that the 0.293 µm particles were already taken up shortly after administration (Figure 3). Numerous nanometer particles were detected at 2 h after gavage, whereas at 4 h the number was already lower. However, only the specific signal for the nanometer-scale PS particles was detectable. These findings together with the computer model underline that MNP PS particles can cross the gastrointestinal barrier and the BBB within a short time, but only 0.293 µm sized particles were able to be taken up from the gastrointestinal tract and to penetrate the BBB. This suggests that the size of the particles may be a critical factor in their ability to penetrate the BBB [42]. The BBB is an important barrier that protects the brain from toxins and other harmful substances, and its breach can lead to various neurological problems. Thus, short-term health effects of MNP will have to be considered, as MNP contamination in brain tissue can lead to cognitive impairment, neurological disorders and neurotoxicity [42], which may be attributed to the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase activity and altered neurotransmitter levels, both of which can contribute to behavioral changes [43]. Plastic particles at the nanoscale have a higher surface area to volume ratio, and they can be more reactive and potentially more harmful than larger microplastics [44]. Our in vivo findings are consistent with other experimental studies, e.g., in mice brain [45] and the brain tissue of zebrafish larvae [46]. \n      Further research is needed to fully understand the health implications and toxicological mechanisms of MNP exposure and develop appropriate safety measures. Specifically, it will be important to investigate the long-term effects of MNP exposure, and the potential for accumulation and distribution of these particles in other tissues and organs.",
        "Conclusion": "4. Conclusions\n      In recent years, plastic pollution has become an increasingly important environmental and human health issue. Although the environmental impacts of plastic pollution have been widely studied, the potential health consequences of plastic consumption on mammals including humans remain to be elucidated. The biomolecular corona is a layer of proteins and other biomolecules that can accumulate on the surface of plastic particles when they are exposed to biological fluids. Before entering the body, MNPs acquire an environmental or eco-corona consisting of biomolecules, organic matter and chemical and biological contaminants, contributing to the corona’s complex and variable composition [8]. The type of corona can therefore significantly impact their ability to enter the BBB and their overall toxicity.\n      Our computer models show that PS plastic particles are able to enter/cross the BBB depending on their specific surface corona, and in vivo mouse models verified these findings, showing accumulations of specifical signals of nanometer-sized PS particles in brain tissues as early as 2 h after exposure. The research also highlighted the importance of understanding the “corona” on the surface of plastic particles when assessing their toxicity. These new insights into the mechanisms for plastic particle transfer provide a valuable foundation for future research and policies aimed at mitigating their harmful effects on human health. Given the widespread use of plastics in our daily lives and the growing concern over the impact of microplastics on the environment and our health, there is an urgent need for more research in this field. By understanding the underlying mechanisms of plastic particle toxicity, we can develop policies and practices to reduce the risks associated with plastic consumption and protect human health.",

        "Introduction": "Introduction\nMicroplastics (MPs) are a global issue because they are released all over the world (Yu et al., 2018; Alimba and Faggio, 2019). In 2018, global plastics output increased to over 359 million tonnes (Mt), up from 348 Mt in 2017 (PlasticsEurope, 2019). Since the 1950s, when plastic items were widely available, global plastic manufacturing has expanded substantially, from 0.5 Mt/year in 1960 to 348 Mt/year in 2017 (PlasticsEurope, 2018). China is the leading producer of plastics, with 107.7 Mt produced in 2018, accounting for 30% of worldwide plastic production (PlasticsEurope, 2019). Borrelle et al. (2020) projected plastic emissions to 2030 for 173 countries, estimating that plastic emissions to aquatic environment will range between 20 and 53 Mt/year by 2030. Different plastic goods have become commonplace in people’s daily lives. Plastics’ use has expanded 25-fold in the previous 40 years owing to minimal cost, durability, low weight, and elasticity (Sutherland et al., 2016). Worldwide, plastics are widely utilized in food packaging, building and construction, automobile items, electrical devices, domestic sports and recreational, farming, healthcare, and plastic furnishings (PlasticsEurope, 2019).\nMPs are microscopic plastic grains that are said to be common in discarded plastic fragment goods (Thompson et al., 2004). Primary MPs are produced small plastic granules to be used in facial-cleansers and cosmetics, air blasting technology, and vectors for drugs in medicine, while secondary nano plastics are tiny plastic remnants deteriorated from MPs debris (Cole et al., 2011; González-Pleiter et al., 2019). The most prevalent waste materials are brought to the seas by rivers, floods, and winds that pollute the ocean and beaches ecosystem. Discarded fishing craft, plastic bags, food containers, and plastic drinks bottles (water and cold drinks) pollute the water ecosystem (Zhou et al., 2018). Mishandling of enormous anthropogenic activities could introduce many xenobiotic pollutants to water environments around the planet, either deliberately or accidentally (Alimba and Faggio, 2019). MPs are reported to be present at all levels of aquatic environments, posing threat to major biota (Ma et al., 2020; Aragaw, 2021).\nMPs have been found in edible fish, according to various research, and as a result of biomagnifications, MPs penetrate human systems (Alfaro-Núñez et al., 2021; Goswami et al., 2020; James et al., 2020). MP-induced impairments in species ranged from minimal biological systems disturbance to substantial unfavorable consequences that resulted in mortality (Mallik et al., 2021). Physiological harm as a result of MPs accumulating within the digestive system; disruption of organisms’ energy flow as a result of MPs expelling as pseudofeces; and inner body tissue exposed to MPs after transfer within the body were all designated as harmful by Ma et al. (2020). They also serve as a pathway for organic contaminants and trace metals to reach aquatic habitats (Gholizadeh and Patimar, 2018). MPs can affect predatory behavior in fish and cause misunderstanding between MPs and genuine prey (de Sá et al., 2015), leading to malnutrition and MP storage in key organs such the gills, gut, and stomach (Lu K. et al., 2018; Güven et al., 2017; Greven et al., 2016). MPs were also found in fish muscle/meat, which is mainly consumed by humans (Thiele et al., 2021; Barboza et al., 2020a,b; Akhbarizadeh et al., 2018; Abbasi et al., 2018). Growth retardation, hormone disruption, metabolic perturbation, oxidative stress, immunological and neurotoxicity malfunction, and genotoxicity behavioural alterations are all caused by a buildup of MPs (Güven et al., 2017; Choi et al., 2018).\nAs fish is a major source of protein for humans, the prevalence and ecotoxicological effects of MPs in fish may influence aquatic food security (Wright and Kelly, 2017; Barboza et al., 2018a). The harmful effects of MPs in fish and humans have been studied in a small number of researches. The goals of this review are to: 1) assess the potentially toxic effects of MPs on fish; 2) determine the impact of MPs on human health, and 3) identify existing knowledge gaps and suggest potential solutions to minimize MPs contamination.",
        "Methods": "Materials and Methods for the Data Collection and Analyses\n\nOnline Study Sites\nData have been collected from many countries around the world. Results from the publications of various scientists and researchers are presented.\n\n\nData Collection\nThe first phase involved the identification of related studies. In order to conduct a systematic literature search, the following specifications were created for the database:\nSearching Database\n\n• Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar, PubMed, Dimension\n\n\n\nSearching Conditions\n\n• Journal articles written in English\n\n\n• Impact of MPs on fish and human-related journals, book chapters, conference proceedings\n\n\n• Accessible over the internet (No time limitation)\n\n\n\nSearching Strings\nThe data were tagged with the keywords “Impacts of microplastics on fish” “Effects of microplastics on fish” “Toxicity of microplastics on fish” or “Adverse impacts of microplastics on fish” or “Biomagnification of microplastics on fish” or “Impacts of microplastics on human” or “Effects of microplastics on human” or “Toxicity of microplastics on human” or “Adverse impacts of microplastics on human”, etc. A search for “Impacts of microplastics on fish and human” in the Dimension database (https://app.dimensions.ai/discover/publication) revealed numerous research papers (Figures 1A,B). To gather information on the effects of microplastics in fish and humans, a total of 800 relevant papers were screened. Following the collection of data, two distinct tables were created from these studies.\n\nFIGURE 1\n\n\n(A) Number of publications on MPs effects in fish (B) MPs effect related research trends on human.\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch Trends About Effects of MPs in Fish and on Human\nMPs pollution is a new environmental concern that poses a risk to fish and human health (Garrido Gamarro et al., 2020; Kutralam-Muniasamy et al., 2020; Huang W. et al., 2021; Aragaw and Mekonnen, 2021). Fish is being contaminated with MPs worldwide and it finds its way to human body through food (Sequeira et al., 2020). Many scientists have recently focused on the effects of MPs in fish and on human health (Chae and An, 2018). Despite the fact that the number of publications is growing, the possible consequences are still largely unknown (Kutralam-Muniasamy et al., 2020). Figures 1A,B depicted research patterns, demonstrating how the effect of MPs studies is growing.\n\n\nBioavailability of MPs to Fish\nMPs are found in practically most of aquatic settings which are the similar size as sediments as well as few planktonic species, subjected them accessible to a variety of aquatic creatures, particularly fish (Pazos et al., 2017; Kumar et al., 2018; Sequeira et al., 2020). The bioavailability of MPs to fish is influenced by a variety of circumstances. Filters and deposit-eating fishes are thought to be more vulnerable to MPs ingestion than predator fishes due to their non-selective feeding behavior (Wesch et al., 2016; Lusher et al., 2020). Mizraji et al. (2017) examined the relationships among tidal fish-eating patterns and the possibility of MPs ingestion and discovered that omnivore fish ingested more MPs than plant-eating and carnivore fish.\nMPs particles that resemble natural prey objects seem to be more likely to be ingested by types of fish that are visual eaters. White MPs were ingested more selectively by Pomatoschistus microps than black and red particles (de Sa et al., 2015). A suitable form or size could improve the likelihood of MPs being consumed by fish (Auta et al., 2017). Boerger et al. (2010) discovered that the most prevalent size class of MPs swallowed by the Myctophidae in the North Pacific Central Gyre was 1–2.79 mm, which is close to the size category of plankton species, that are the principal food supply for all of these fishes.\nMPs’ vertically positioning in the water column is mostly determined by their volume, which may affect the probability of fish encountering MPs in various fish regions (de Sá et al., 2018). Pelagic fishes, for example, seem to be more likely to come across low-density plastics, whereas demersal fish may be more prone to high MPs (Lusher et al., 2013). Moreover, there are many unknowns concerning the fundamental factors that regulate fish choice eating patterns for MPs. The interaction method involving MPs and fish still has to be studied extensively.\n\n\nBiomagnifications and Trophic Transfer\nBiomagnification has been observed in a variety of fish and other species higher up the food chain (Figure 2). MPs were found in planktivorous fish, according to Boerger et al. (2010), that biomagnified to bigger predatory feeding on the fish. Biomagnifications have been observed in bluefin tuna, albacore tuna, and swordfish in the Mediterranean Sea (Romeo et al., 2015). MPs were found to be transferred tropically from Scombrus scombrus to Halichoerus grypus, reported by Nelms et al. (2019). Low density MPs can be expelled as pseudofeces by fish though most of the MPs remain in gastrointestinal tract of fish (Capone et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2021a; Prata et al., 2022). Biomagnifications from marine species to humans could occur in the same way. Although biomagnification research has been explored, there are few of them. The big facts of biomagnifications and trophic transmission cannot be fully appreciated with these limited investigations. As a result, more research in this area is required.\n\nFIGURE 2\n\nPotential sources and transfer of MPs in fish.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Do Fish React to the Toxicity of Microplastics?\nMany researchers have studied the negative consequences of microplastics on species, which can vary from interruption of biological functions to death. MPs poisoning is categorized as follows depending on the nature of MPs after intake:\n\n1) build-up in the gastrointestinal tract, producing physical harm such as blockage and damage;\n\n\n2) release as pseudofeces, disrupting organisms’ energy transfer;\n\n\n3) transfer inside the body, exposing inner organs and tissues to MPs.\n\n\n\nMPs-caused detrimental effects on species were outlined to provide a solid research foundation for sustainable MPs toxicological investigations and to evaluate the potential for huge ecological disruption.\n\n\nImpacts of MPs, in Fish\nMPs exposure has been studied in respect of particular physical or biological reactions. So far, most investigations on the effects of MPs on fish have been undertaken in the laboratory (Supplementary Table S1). The fish used in the MPs exposure tests came from a variety of environments, with the bulk coming from the sea. MPs may build up in the gastrointestinal system of fish after consumption, producing obstructions across the digestive tract and limiting feeding owing to appetite (Lusher et al., 2013; Wright et al., 2013). Intake of MPs could also induce anatomical and functional changes in the digestive tracts, causing dietary and development issues in fish (Huang et al., 2022; Jabeen et al., 2018; Borrelle et al., 2017; Peda et al., 2016). Many pieces of research have been carried to demonstrate that MPs pose a threat to fish, with mortality occurring frequently before they reach maturity owing to MPs intake (Figure 3). Most of the studies were conducted on Danio rerio. Oxidative stress, decreased mobility, gene expression disruption and damage of reproductive organs are the most common effects of MPs in Danio rerio (Mu et al., 2021; Zhao et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2022).\n\nFIGURE 3\n\nPossible effects of MPs in fish body after ingestion.\n\n\n\n\nOryzias melastigma was second most studied fish that subjected to physical impairment due to MPs ingestion (Xia et al., 2022). Growth inhibition, dysbiosis of fish gut, reduction of weight, disturbance of anti-oxidative condition of the liver, damaging reproductive organs and growth retardation are visible effects in Oryzias melastigma (Wang et al., 2022; Zhang X. et al., 2021; Feng et al., 2021; Li et al., 2021; Le Bihanic et al., 2020) (Supplementary Table S1). Sparus aurata is another important consumable fish that affected by MPs ingestion. This fish faced stress, oxidative damage, survival, Behavior changes and damage of immune system’s key functions (Espinosa et al., 2017; Pannetier et al., 2020; Jacob et al., 2021; Rios-Fuster et al., 2021; Solomando et al., 2021) (Supplementary Table S1).\n\n\nMicroplastics in humans\nThe presence of MPs in seafood poses a major hazard to human health. Seafood is an essential part of the human diet. MPs contamination of the intestinal system poses a serious risk of spreading to other regions of the body. Endocytosis and persorption are two of the most common methods for MPs to enter the human body (Figure 4). Toxicological impacts may reduce fish performance, which is of considerable consideration of humans who eat fish as a major part of their meal, and may have severe impacts on catching fish (Naji et al., 2017; Kor et al., 2020; Kor and Mehdinia, 2020). More examination into these concerns is required, taking into account realistic MP and pollutant levels in the ecosystem (Neves et al., 2015).\n\nFIGURE 4\n\nDifferent process of MPs uptake from gastrointestinal tract (GIT) after exposure (Modified from Galloway, 2015 and Wright and Kelly, 2017).\n\n\n\n\n\nToxicological Effects in Human Health\nSwelling and blockage are caused due to the buildup of MPs and nano plastics in tissues (Wang et al., 2016; Wright et al., 2013). In vitro tests revealed that MPs concentrate in the gills, stomachs, and metabolic systems of crabs and cause unfavorable cellular alterations in fish (Karbalaei et al., 2018; Brennecke et al., 2015). Microorganisms and pollutants have also been shown to be transported by them (Manzoor et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2016). Such negative consequences were mostly determined by the individual’s level of exposure and sensitivity (Prata et al., 2020). Exposure to MPs has also been linked to oxidative stress, cytotoxicity, and transfer to other tissues (Figure 5) (Galloway, 2015; Schirinzi et al., 2017; Wright and Kelly, 2017; Anbumani and Kakkar, 2018).\n\nFIGURE 5\n\nPossible effects of MPs in human body after exposure.\n\n\n\nMPs are long-lasting in the ecosystem and biological organisms. As a result, the animals are exposed to MPs for an extended period, potentially leading to chronic discomfort, swelling, cell growth, and death, as well as immune cell impairment (Smith et al., 2018). Inflammatory bowel disease was significantly higher in patients with MPs than the healthy people (Yan et al., 2021). PS MPs decreased the growth of Caco-2 cells over time (Wu et al., 2020). The mitochondrial membrane potential was disturbed by PS MPs, according to Wu et al. (2019). MPs may also serve as vectors for a variety of microbes (Kirstein et al., 2016). They can eject compounds from their matrixes or absorb substances from the surrounding (Crawford and Quinn, 2017).\n\n\nOxidative Stress and Cytotoxicity\nOxidative stress, consequent inflammatory, and cytotoxic impacts were thought to be the main effects for MPs toxicity in inhalation exposure experiments (Table 1). MPs can induce oxidative stress by producing oxidizing substances adsorbing to their surface, as well as reactive oxygen radicals created by the host during the inflammation (Kelly and Fussel, 2012; Valavanidis et al., 2013). Forte et al. (2016) used nanoparticles to stimulate pro-inflammatory replies in A549 lung cells and human gastric cancer cells. Green et al. (1998) found that larger polyethylene particles (0.3–10 m) promote the development of cytokines such as IL-6, IL-1b, and TNF-a, some of which are inflammatory agents.\n\nTABLE 1\n\nPossible lethal effects of micro-and nano plastics on human health.\n\n\n\n\nToxic effects\nCharacteristics of Plastic Particles\nParticle size\nDetails\nReferences\n\n\n\n\nInflammation\nPolystyrene particles\n202 and 535 nm\n* Expression of IL-8 is increased\n\nDeng et al., 2017; Forte et al., 2016; Fuchs et al., 2016; Prietl et al., 2014; Nich and Goodman, 2014; Brown et al., 2011; Green et al., 1998; Devane et al., 1995a,b\n\n\n\nUnaltered/Carboxylated polystyrene nanoparticles\n20, 44, 500, and 1000 nm\n* Inflammation was induced in human A549 lung cells\n\n\n* Expression of IL-6 and IL-8 is increased\n\n\nCarboxylated and amino-modified polystyrene particles\n120 nm\n* Multiple human cancers have increased inflammation\n\n\n* Scavenger receptor expression is altered\n\n\nUnaltered polyethylene particles\n0–3 μm, 10 µm\n* The production of IL-10 was enhanced in M2 cells\n\n\n* TGF (31 (ML) levels have increased, as does energy metabolism (M2)\n\n\nPolyethylene particles from plastic prosthetic implants\n0.2 and 10 µm\n* Increased IL-6, IL-113, and TNFa production in murine macrophages\n\n\n* TNFct, IL-1, and RANKL expression were all increased\n\n\nPolystyrene MPs particles\n5 and 20 µm\n* Periprosthetic bone resorption occurred as a result\n\n\n* Induced inflammatory reaction around the implant\n\n\n* The liver is inflamed as a result of the inflammation\n\n\n* Neurotransmission has been harmed as a result of the induction\n\n\nOxidative stress and apoptosis\nAmine-modified polystyrene nanoparticles\n60 nm\n* Mucin has strong interaction and aggregation\n\nMahadevan and Valiyaveettil, 2021; Inkielewicz-Stepniak et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2018; Chiu et al., 2015; Ruenraroengsak and Tetley, 2015; Paget et al., 2015; Thubagere and Reinhard, 2010; Xia et al., 2008\n\n\n\n* Apoptosis was induced in all intestinal epithelial cells\n\n\nCationic polystyrene nanoparticles\n60 nm\n* ROS production and ER stress are both induced\n\n\n* Autophagic cell death in mice macrophages and lung epithelial cells has been induced\n\n\nUnaltered or functionalized polystyrene polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA)\n20, 40, 50, and 100 nm\n* Apoptosis was induced in a variety of human cell types\n\n\n120 nm, 140 nm\n* Reduced cell viability due to a decrease in ATP and an increase in ROS levels\n\n\nMetabolic homeostasis\nPristine and fluorescent polystyrene MPs\n5 µm\n* Amino-addition and bile-addition metabolism changes\n\nLuo et al., 2019a; Jin et al., 2019; McCarthy et al., 2011\n\n\n\n* Induced dysbiosis of the gut microbiota and intestinal barrier failure\n\n\n* Ionic homeostasis and altered ion channel function\n\n\nAnionic carboxylated polystyrene nanoparticles\n20 nm\n* Basolateral K+ channels that have been activated\n\n\n* Cl− and HCO3\n− ion outflow is induced\n\n\nPolystyrene nanoparticles\n30 nm\n* The distribution of cytokinesis-associated proteins and blocked vesicle transit\n\nStock et al., 2019; Luo et al., 2019a,b; Wang et al., 2020; Deng et al., 2017; Xia et al., 2016; Mahler et al., 2012\n\n\n\nCationic polystyrene nanoparticles\n50 and 200 nm\n* Intestinal iron transit and cellular uptake have been disrupted\n\n\n* Hepatic ATP levels are reduced\n\n\n* Deficiency in energy metabolism\n\n\nPristine polystyrene microparticles\n5 and 20 µm\n* The metabolic condition is associated with dysbiosis of the gut microbiota and a breakdown of the gut barrier\n\n\nMPs\n0.5 and 5 µm\n* Increased the chances of metabolic disorders in children\n\n\n\n\nDue to the polymerization and processing, MPs include reactive oxygen species. Nevertheless, reactions with UV radiation or the existence of reactive metals may cause such free radicals to be greatly amplified. MPs aging also resulted in the formation of free radicals, which oxidized the target tissues (Gewert et al., 2015). Polystyrene nanoparticles link with the surface of the intestinal epithelial, according to Inkielewicz-Stepniak et al. (2018). Nanoplastics caused epithelial cells to oxidize, according to the research (Inkielewicz-Stepniak et al., 2018). Acute toxins and free radicals have been observed to be released by limbs and joint prostheses incorporating MPs in humans because of severe inflammatory reaction. Those oxidants were shown to cause hydrolysis, which led to polymer degradation, breaking, and leaking. This free radical manufacturing process may cause the prosthesis to be rejected by the human organs (Sternschuss et al., 2012).\nMPs were found to be cytotoxic as an effect of oxidative damage and inflammation (Table 1). MPs can be absorbed by certain cells, such as macrophages, as revealed in animal research and in vitro tests (Geiser et al., 2005; Yacobi et al., 2008). MPs interacted easily with intracellular organelles since they were not membrane-bound, posing a risk of damage (Geiser et al., 2005). In vitro studies by Furukuma and Fujii, 2016) revealed that MPs particles are cytotoxic. Schirinzi et al. (2017) found that MPs at levels of 0.05–10 mg/L produced reactive oxygen species to high levels, contributing to cytotoxicity in the human brain and epithelial cells in in vitro research. Furthermore, in vitro contact of macrophages and lung epithelial cells to nano plastics enhanced reactive oxygen radicals, causing unfolded proteins particle agglomeration in the endoplasmic reticulum and cytolysis (Chiu et al., 2015). Thubagere and Reinhard (2010) found that polystyrene particles were cytotoxic to adenomatous cells of the tiny intestine. As a result, individuals exposed to MPs may cause cytotoxicity and oxidative damage. Moreover, no strong cytotoxic effects were found in multiple in vitro investigations even at high levels (Magri et al., 2018; Stock et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2019).\n\n\nChanging the Body’s Metabolism and Energy Flow\nMPs can either directly influence metabolism by altering metabolic enzymes or circuitously by upsetting the energy equilibrium. By boosting or lowering energy consumption, decreasing nutritional intake, and regulating metabolic enzymes, MPs exhibit metabolic impacts (Table 1). Humans, on the other hand, have higher energy requirements and more sophisticated metabolic processes than the creatures studied, which could affect the metabolic impacts (Table 1).\n\n\nImmune System Dysfunction\nMPs were reported to cause systemic or local immune responses after exposure, based on their dispersion and human reaction. Environmental exposure to MPs, on the other hand, was enough to impair immune systems in biologically vulnerable individuals, resulting in autoimmune disorders or immunosuppression (Table 1) (Prata, 2018; Prata et al., 2020). According to Farhat et al. (2011), chronic damage in cells, the production of immune modulators, and the incorrect stimulation of immune cells may all contribute to MP-induced autoimmune disorders. Antibodies against self-antigens would be produced as an outcome of this chain of events (Farhat et al., 2011). In addition, exposure to MPs has been linked to autoimmune rheumatic illness and systemic lupus erythematosus (Fernandes et al., 2015; Bernatsky et al., 2016). MPs have the potential to alter human immunological function, albeit this has yet to be proven. As a result, more research into the impacts on human immune systems is required.\n\n\nTranslocation of Cells to Other Tissues\nMPs may transfer to distal tissues via the circulatory system after exposure. Internalization of MPs in the cardiovascular system instigated an inflammatory reaction, blood cell cytotoxicity, vascular swelling, obstructions, and respiratory high blood pressure (Table 1) (Wright and Kelly, 2017; Campanale et al., 2020). In vitro tests revealed that nanoparticles exposure can cause red blood cell coagulation and endothelium wall adherence (Barshtein et al., 2016). MPs accelerated hemolysis and contributed to the production of histamine, a pro-inflammatory molecule, according to Hwang et al. (2019). The most significant method of MP transfer is enhanced porosity of the epithelial membrane as a result of inflammation (Prata et al., 2020). Wick et al. (2010) revealed that 240 nm nanoparticles may easily pass the placental barrier in a perfusion model of the human placenta. Polystyrene particles were taken up by an ex vivo human placental perfusion model, which then penetrated the placental barrier without affecting the stability of the explant. Particles were transferred through intracellular and extracellular transporter proteins, as well as diffusion. The results from this study point to the possibility of nanoparticles being transported across the placenta (Wick et al., 2010). Grafmueller et al. (2015) used an ex vivo human placental perfusion model to show that polystyrene nanoparticles have a similar capability to breach the placenta barrier.\n\nIn vitro tests revealed that when subjected to nano plastics (44 nm), human renal cortical epithelial cells ingested them without cleaning, even after 90 min (Monti et al., 2015). The buildup of particles, on the other hand, caused considerable impairments in renal active operation (Monti et al., 2015). MPs may cause persistent inflammation, impaired organ function, and a higher risk of neoplasia when transferred to distal tissues (Prata et al., 2020). MPs may promote bone loss by stimulating osteoclasts after they reach the bone (Liu et al., 2015; Ormsby et al., 2016). Inconsistencies with the data have been discovered by Braeuning (2019), such as mass disparity of MP tissue burden vs. actual ingestion and the failure to account for MPs’ existence in other bodily tissues. As a result, toxicokinetic features of MPs must be considered when evaluating their absorption, dispersion, and effects (Böhmert et al., 2019).\n\n\nNeurotoxicity\n\nIn vivo neurotoxicity has been documented following persistent exposure to particulate matter, particularly MPs, perhaps due to immune cell activation and oxidative stress in the brain (Table 1). These events could be the result of direct interaction with teleported particles or the effects of circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines that result in long-term neuronal injury (MohanKumar et al., 2008). MPs have been shown to have an effect on neuronal function and behaviour in vivo. Exposure to MPs elevated AChE activity in the brain and altered serum neurotransmitters, according to Deng et al. (2017). Nanoplastics were capable of creating toxicity and impairing metabolic activity in brain cell types in an in vitro investigation due to the high level of bioactive chemicals.\n\n\nCarcinogenicity\nFor generations, human contact with plastic items has been associated with malignancies. Nevertheless, no conclusive proof has been established until now. According to Prata (2018), prolonged inflammation and irritation caused by MPs consumption may induce cancer by causing DNA damage (Table 1). According to Chang (2010), oxidative stress and persistent irritation generated by nano plastics revealed evidence of pro-inflammatory agents, which stimulated vasculature, that led to the creation and development of cancers.\n\n\nCombine Effects (MPs With Other Pollutants)\nSince MPs inclusion in the manufacturing process, they were observed to include a variety of exogenous chemical additions and colors. MPs were frequently detected with persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and phthalates, bisphenol A (BPA), bisphenone, triclosan, organotin, and brominated flame retardants. During the production process of the items, these POPs are applied as additives to plastics (Galloway 2015; EFSA, 2016; Prata et al., 2020). Emollients such as phthalates, for example, are used to soften plastics by lowering the attraction of molecular chains inside the synthetic polymer matrix. BPA is a component monomer in polycarbonate that is used in catering packaging (Cole et al., 2011).\nPOPs, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), as well as heavy metals like lead, nickel, cadmium, and zinc, were found in MPs retrieved from various environments (Crawford and Quinn, 2017; Wright and Kelly, 2017). Such chemicals are prone to leaching since no chemical linkages between them and the matrix of MPs (Wright and Kelly, 2017). Structural substances on the surface of MPs were said to travel along the concentration gradient at a consistent rate when they were broken. When MPs come into touch with bodily surfaces and are transported to the deeper tissues, contaminants like these may be produced (Browne et al., 2011). Those chemicals showed the capacity to interact with endogenous hormones even at low doses (Cole et al., 2011).\nMPs worked as vectors, delivering germs to target tissues, protecting them from the immune structure, causing pro-inflammatory replies, and potentially facilitating infections (Kirsten et al., 2016). When MPs came into touch with bacteria and chemicals, their large surface area made them vulnerable to becoming vectors (Prata et al., 2020). When compared to the daily consumption of food and dust, MPs may have a minor impact on harmful chemical exposure (Bakir et al., 2014). Numerous MP exposures, on the other hand, could significantly increase their amounts. Monomers, additives, and degradation products carried by MPs, according to Rodrigues et al. (2019), could offer significant human health concerns if transmitted.\n\nVibrio sp., among the most aggressive bacteria, could populate the surface of MPs, according to Kirsten et al., 2016). MPs, on the other hand, were discovered to affect the variety and activity of the gut microbiome reported by Zhu et al. (2018). Once humans are exposed to a large number of MPs through consumption, such impacts could have serious consequences. According to West-Eberhard (2019), exposure to MPs can affect the gut microbiota, resulting in the rapid growth of opportunistic species, an upsurge in pro-inflammatory responses, and endotoxemia (Table 1). The harmful effects of chemicals or microbes adsorbed onto MPs, on the other hand, are greatly reliant on the types and concentrations of swallowed particle, vector particle transportation, release profile, and pollutant lethality in human body cells (Campanale et al., 2020; Prata et al., 2020).\nBPA is utilized as an antioxidant and a stabilizer that has the potential to damage the endocrine system (Yamamoto et al., 2001; Halden, 2010). It can move out of polycarbonates and adhere to consumable food, allowing it to be consumed by humans (Calafat et al., 2008). BPA poisoning has been found in tuna fish, pork, and tap water, demonstrating how this toxin can enter highly eaten foods (Colin et al., 2014). BPA levels in the urine of 167 men were shown to be negatively proportionate to serum levels of inhibin B and the estradiol: testosterone ratio, indicating a detrimental effect on hormone levels, according to Meeker et al. (2010). BPA may potentially have a role in the development of overweight by disrupting alpha and beta receptors in fat tissues, changing fat tissue hormone levels, and interacting with the action of lipoprotein lipase, aromatase, and lipogenesis regulators (Vom Saal et al., 2012; Michalowicz, 2014). It has the potential to cause breast and prostate cancer in mammalian species, as well as cancer in humans (Michalowicz, 2014). Many chemical substances found in plastics or firmly attached to MPs, such as leftover low molecular weight styrenes, PAHs, PVC monomer, PCBs, PBDEs, OCPs, and pharmaceutical drugs, which include their metabolites, are toxic to humans, genotoxicity, and hormonal disruptors after being ingested, according to study.\n\n\nFuture Perspectives/Knowledge Gaps\n\n\n\n\n→ The majority of research is done in laboratories, although wild fish must be used in some experiments. The conditions in the lab are very different from those in the real world. Experiment with wild fish to see if there is a difference in the results. A significant future scientific goal should be to increase the number of comparative laboratory-field experiments with parallel exposure in order to evaluate and strengthen our understanding of the real-world impact of MPs.\n\n\n\n→ Non-destructive sampling should be maintained. Destructive sampling damages tissue and genetic components in the specimens collected. Destructive sampling makes species-level identification of fish nearly impossible in most circumstances, rendering this methodology inappropriate.\n\n\n\n→ MPs’ harmful impact on aquatic organisms at various phases of development. Most of the research was carried out in the juvenile stage. Research should be conducted in other stages (e.g., larval, adult stage). MPs exposure must be compared throughout life stages and sexes in order to draw appropriate conclusions about a species’ sensitivity. At the moment, findings from a small number of researches imply that younger people and women have a higher inclination to consume more MPs and are more vulnerable to MPs pollution.\n\n\n\n→ Proof of the negative effects of MP on individuals, groups, and ecosystems. There are very few negative consequences available. More research is needed to confirm MPs’ deleterious impacts. Journals, newspapers, magazines, and different websites are not interested to publish findings if the experiments have no effects on fish and humans. That’s why some researchers always try to show negative effects instead of actual findings.\n\n\n\n→ Ingestion of MP, internalization and transport potential should be identified. Ingestion routes in the body and how they connect to the gut wall, as well as MPs trophic transfer.\n\n\n\n→ MPs’ role as vectors for sorbed persistent organic pollutants and metals exposure and bioaccumulation. Many pathogens and contaminants are transported by MPs. It is necessary to define the role of MPs as carriers to identify the ecotoxicological effects of MPs in fish.\n\n\n\n→ The influence of related additional compounds on the effects of MPs on aquatic creatures. MPs, in combination with other pollutants, have severe negative effects on organisms, which MPs alone cannot always achieve. It is necessary to determine how much the presence of MPs contributes to fish exposure to these hazardous compounds.

        "Conclusion": "Conclusion\nPlastic is a valuable, useful, and useful material that is used to make up the bulk of the items in daily life; however, in today’s world, mismanagement, improper handling, and abuse of plastics have resulted in MPs pollution in every edge of the aquatic environment, from the highest-ranked pelagic layer to seafloor sedimentary rocks. Because MPs are abundant in aquatic ecosystems, fish species have easy access to them. A growing body of research demonstrates that MPs are toxic to a wide range of fish. MPs can collect in the gastrointestinal system of fish after intake and then disperse to other body tissues. MPs can cause a variety of health concerns in fish. Toxic substances and dangerous germs may potentially be transmitted to fish through MPs. Humans eat plastic-tainted fish and are exposed to plastic particles. As a consequence, several chronic illness outbreaks occur, and people suffer the effects. As a result, reducing MPs contamination is critical. Implementing efficient waste management methods, enhancing the shelf life of plastic items, and increasing awareness can substantially limit the input of litter into environments, allowing the aquatic ecosystem to be recovered.",

        "Abstract": " Recent advances in dementia research have expanded our understanding of modifiable risk factors, with air pollution being a well-established contributor. However, microplastics—plastic particles smaller than 5 mm—represent an understudied component of environmental pollution that may significantly impact neurological health. This review examines emerging evidence linking chronic microplastic exposure to increased dementia risk. Microplastics enter the human body through multiple routes, including ingestion of contaminated food and water, inhalation, and dermal absorption, with demonstrated ability to cross the blood–brain barrier and initiate several pathogenic pathways. Four primary mechanisms appear to mediate microplastic-induced neurodegeneration: increased oxidative stress through reactive oxygen species (ROS) production; neuroinflammation via microglial activation and chronic inflammatory responses; neurotoxicity from transported persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and heavy metals; and accelerated amyloid-beta pathology through enhanced Aβ40 and Aβ42 nucleation. Recent bioaccumulation studies have revealed significantly elevated microplastic concentrations in the brains of dementia patients compared to non-dementia controls, supporting a potential dose-dependent relationship. Sources of environmental microplastics include industrial waste, synthetic textiles, plastic degradation products, and tire wear particles, creating a ubiquitous exposure risk through contaminated air, food, and water. While preliminary evidence supports a mechanistic link between microplastics and neurodegeneration, comprehensive epidemiological studies with larger datasets are needed to quantify this relationship and establish dose–response patterns. Future research should focus on identifying which microplastic types pose the greatest neurological risks, determining threshold exposure levels, and developing interventions to mitigate exposure.",
        "Introduction": "1\nIntroduction\nDementia represents a significant public health challenge in the 21st century, currently affecting approximately 55 million individuals worldwide, with projections indicating this number may nearly triple by 2050. Recent advancements in dementia research have considerably enhanced our understanding of various modifiable risk factors associated with this condition. Current evidence identifies multiple potentially modifiable risk factors for dementia development, including sensory impairments (hearing loss), cardiovascular factors (hypertension), lifestyle behaviors (smoking, obesity, physical inactivity), metabolic conditions (diabetes), psychological factors (depression), social determinants (isolation), and environmental exposures (air pollution). These findings highlight the multifactorial etiology of dementia and underscore the importance of comprehensive preventive strategies addressing these diverse risk domains (1). This evolving understanding underscores the multifactorial nature of dementia pathogenesis and highlights the importance of environmental factors in neurodegenerative processes.\nAmong environmental risk factors, air pollution has emerged as a significant contributor to dementia risk. Numerous epidemiological studies have demonstrated associations between atmospheric particulate matter (PM₂.₅ and PM₁₀) exposure and increased incidence of dementia, Alzheimer’s disease, and mild cognitive impairment. However, the specific components of air pollution responsible for neurotoxic effects remain incompletely characterized (2).\nMicroplastics represent an increasingly ubiquitous environmental contaminant that has received limited attention in dementia research. Defined as plastic particles smaller than 5 mm, microplastics have infiltrated virtually every environmental compartment, including air, water, and soil (3). Recent evidence demonstrates that microplastics can enter the human body through multiple routes, cross biological barriers including the blood–brain barrier, and potentially initiate or exacerbate pathological processes linked to neurodegenerative diseases (4).\nThis review examines the emerging evidence linking chronic microplastic exposure to increased dementia risk, building upon established connections between air pollution and cognitive decline. We explore the sources and routes of microplastic exposure, mechanisms of microplastic-induced neurotoxicity, and recent findings regarding microplastic bioaccumulation in human brain tissue. Additionally, we identify critical knowledge gaps and future research directions necessary to establish microplastics as a potential modifiable risk factor for dementia.",

        "Conclusion": "6\nConclusion\nThe emerging evidence linking microplastic exposure to potential neurodegeneration represents a significant development in our understanding of environmental risk factors for dementia. Through multiple pathogenic mechanisms including oxidative stress induction, neuroinflammation promotion, neurotoxic chemical transport, and amyloid-beta pathology acceleration, microplastics may contribute to the complex etiology of dementia. Recent findings confirming microplastic bioaccumulation in human brain tissue, with notably higher concentrations in individuals with dementia, lend support to this hypothesis.\nHowever, considerable research challenges and knowledge gaps remain. Standardized methodologies, comprehensive exposure assessment, detailed mechanistic understanding, and longitudinal epidemiological data are needed to establish microplastics as a causative factor in dementia pathogenesis and to inform effective intervention strategies.\nGiven the rapidly increasing environmental microplastic burden and the projected rise in dementia prevalence, addressing these research priorities has significant implications for both environmental policy and public health (51). If confirmed through rigorous investigation, microplastic exposure may represent a novel modifiable risk factor for dementia, offering new opportunities for prevention strategies and highlighting the interconnectedness of environmental and neurological health.",

        "Abstract": " The ubiquitous exposure of humans to microplastics (MPs) through inhalation of particles in air and ingestion in dust, water, and diet is well established. Humans are estimated to ingest tens of thousands to millions of MP particles annually, or on the order of several milligrams daily. Available information suggests that inhalation of indoor air and ingestion of drinking water bottled in plastic are the major sources of MP exposure. Little is known on the occurrence of MPs in human diet. Evidence is accumulating that feeding bottles and medical devices can contribute to MP exposure in newborns and infants. Biomonitoring studies of human stool, fetus, and placenta provide direct evidence of MP exposure in infants and children. MPs <20 µm were reported to cross biological membranes. Although plastics were once perceived as inert materials, MP exposure in laboratory animals is linked to various forms of inflammation, immunological response, endocrine disruption, alteration of lipid and energy metabolism, and other disorders. Whereas exposure to MPs itself is a concern, MPs can also be sources of exposure to plastic additives and other toxicants. Exposure of human cell lines to MP additives such as phthalates, bisphenols, and organotins causes adverse effects through the activation of nuclear receptors, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) α, β, and γ, and retinoid X receptor (RXR), leading to oxidative stress, cytotoxicity, immunotoxicity, thyroid hormone disruption, and altered adipogenesis and energy production. The size, shape, chemical composition, surface charge, and hydrophobicity of MPs influence their toxicity. Maternal transfer of MPs to the developing fetus has been demonstrated in exposed laboratory animals and through the analysis of human placenta. In laboratory animal studies, maternal exposure to MPs altered energy and lipid metabolism in offspring and subsequent generations. Moreover, concomitant with the global increase in plastics production, the prevalence of overweight and obesity in human populations has increased over the past five decades, and there is evidence to support the hypothesis that MPs and their additives are potential obesogens. Even though MP exposures are ubiquitous and toxic effects from such exposures are a concern, systematic studies on this topic remain urgently needed.",
        "Introduction": "Introduction\nGlobal plastic pollution is a significant environmental and public health concern (1–5). A total of approximately 8300 million metric tons of plastics were manufactured from 1950 to 2015 (6), and production rate has been increasing, reaching 368 million metric tons (annually) in 2019 (\nFigure 1\n). Plastics are resistant to chemical and biological degradation and therefore durable. Furthermore, their low density and expense coupled with corrosion resistance make them suitable for use in an enormous variety of consumer products. There are currently at least 45 different types of plastics in commercial use, including polypropylene (PP), polyethylene (PE), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polystyrene (PS), polyurethane (PU), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and polycarbonate (PC) (7). According to Plastic Europe (2013) (www.plasticseurope.org/application/files/7815/1689/9295/2013plastics_the_facts_PubOct2013.pdf), of the ~288 million tons of plastics produced in 2012, 85 million tons (~30%) were PE, 54 million tons (19%) were PP, and 31 million tons (11%) were PVC. PE (as low- and high-density material; LDPE/HDPE) is used in producing plastic films (35 million tons annually) that are finished as carrier bags, sandwich bags, food wraps and containers, straws, toys, mulch, irrigation pipes, packaging foam, cling wrap, and electrical cables, among other products. PP is the second most widely used thermoplastic worldwide, in applications ranging from plastic packaging, plastic parts for machinery and equipment, and medical devices to fibers and textiles. PVC is used in buildings (e.g., window shutters, water pipes, and upholstery), shampoo and cooking-oil bottles, insulation for electric cables, and cling films. PS is used in buildings and in moldable materials, especially for the production of disposable plates and cups, meat trays, egg cartons, carryout containers, and electronic goods. PET, which is related to PE, is used in textile fibers for clothing manufacture (as polyester) and in containers for liquids (e.g., water, juice, and soft drink bottles) and foods (8). PET is an excellent replacement product for glass, and its demand is 14.5 million tons annually (Plastic Europe, 2008: https://www.plasticseurope.org/application/files/2815/1689/9283/2006compelling_fact_PubJan2008.pdf). Consumption rates of plastics vary between countries-according to Plastics Insight (https://www.plasticsinsight.com/world-per-capita-consumption-pe-pp-pvc-resins-2014), per capita plastic consumption levels in the United States and India in 2014 were 95 and 8 kg, respectively — but continue to increase on a global basis. Concurrent with the production and use of plastics, the generation of plastic waste has increased exponentially in the past 4 decades (6).\n\nFigure 1\n\nGlobal annual plastic production and prevalence of overweight over the past 4 decades (Source: Plastics - The Facts 2020, page 16; WHO: https://apps.who.int/gho/data/view.main.GLOBAL2461A?lang=e; Obesity data from: CDC: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db360.htm).\n\n\n\nIt is generally believed that large plastic polymers are inert and are not absorbed by the intestinal system (due to their size), and therefore are excreted un-metabolized. However, upon entering the environment and/or in biological systems, plastics break down into small particles through biotic and abiotic weathering and transformation processes, creating massive amounts of smaller plastic particles in the environment, including plastic particles of <5 mm that are termed ‘microplastics’ (MPs) (9). An estimated 75,000–300,000 tons of MPs are released by plastics breakdown annually in the EU alone (10). As plastics continue to break down in the environment, the fraction of MPs in the total mass of plastic waste has been predicted to reach 13% by 2060 and will continue to increase (11). MPs are classified as primary or secondary based on their source of environmental release. Primary MPs are those deliberately manufactured at sizes <5 mm for use in applications such as microbeads in facial cleansers/scrubs, shower gels, and scrubbing pads (dish washing), as well as microfibers from clothing (dish cloths and towels) (12–17). Secondary MPs are those generated from plastic polymers through normal weathering processes, including erosion, abrasion, corrosion, photo-oxidation (chemical), and biological transformation (18–21). MPs are also classified based on their physicochemical properties as microfibers from cloth (fleece, diapers, cigarette butts), fragments (larger particles from cutlery and lids), nurdles (plastic pellets), foams (cups, plates, food packaging containers), microbeads (plastics <1 mm in diameter; used in toiletries, facial cleansers, exfoliating soap products and toothpaste), and nanoplastics (plastics 1–100 nm in diameter; potentially derived from disintegration of MPs) (22, 23).\nMPs persist in the environment for hundreds to thousands of years. For example, plastic PET water bottles, disposable diapers, and PS foams have been estimated to have lifespans of 450, 500, and >5,000 years in the environment, respectively (https://www.goecopure.com/lifespan-of-plastic.aspx). Not only is pollution by MPs themselves a significant environmental concern, but plastic particles also can release additives and other performance-enhancing chemicals that are incorporated into the polymers during production. These include inorganic fillers (to fortify the plastic), heat stabilizers (to impart heat resistance), plasticizers (to make plastic flexible and pliant), flame retardants (to provide ignition and fire resistance), UV stabilizers (to prevent degradation from sunlight/photo-oxidation), colorants (to provide opacity and matte finish), and luster additives (to enhance appearance). Owing to their high costs, these additives are typically added in relatively small concentrations (8, 24–26), but they may have potent biological effects. Additives including bisphenols, phthalates, benzothiazoles, organotins, and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) leach out of plastics during usage and/or after disposal (8, 27–32). Aquatic and terrestrial pollution by plastics additives has been extensively documented. Furthermore, MPs can act as vectors for various other contaminants, as they sequester organic and inorganic pollutants from the surrounding environment (33).\nSeveral studies have reported the ubiquitous occurrence of MPs in various environmental matrices, including surface water, sediment, wastewater, Arctic and Antarctic sea ice, indoor and outdoor air, bottled water, and select food products (7, 34–44). Whereas studies of MP pollution in the aquatic environment, especially the oceanic environment, have received considerable attention for over a decade, effects of MPs on human health have attracted notice quite recently, following the detection of MPs in seafood, honey, milk, beer, table salt, drinking water, and air (45). Furthermore, the identification of MPs in human placenta raised serious concern about exposure in utero (46). A meta-analysis of existing data on the concentrations of MPs in various sources of human exposure suggested a mean ingestion dose in the range of 0.10–5 g/week (47). Zhang et al. (48) assessed the mass of PET and PC MPs recovered from the feces of dogs and cats, which were used as surrogates for biomonitoring of MPs in humans, and found an excretion rate of 0.03–677 mg MPs/week. These exposure dose estimates are several orders of magnitude higher than those for other toxicants, such as phthalates, bisphenols, and toxic metals. Thus, there is clear evidence of substantial human exposure to MPs.\nAlthough plastics were thought of as inert materials, several studies in recent years have described health risks from exposure to MPs in humans. Among the various toxic effects reported in laboratory animals from exposure to MPs and plastic additives, the disruption of adipogenesis and lipid metabolism through the activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) suggests that MP exposure may be linked to the increasing prevalence of obesity globally. The increase in global plastics production over the past 50 years is in line with the rate of increase in overweight and obesity in human populations (\nFigure 1\n). Thus, there is an immediate need to assess the sources, pathways, and potential health effects of MPs in humans, with a focus on obesogenic mechanisms, among others. In this review, we summarize available information on the sources and pathways of human exposure to MPs and on their toxic effects, especially those related to obesogenic mechanisms of MP toxicity.",

        "Conclusion": "Conclusions\nMPs are pervasive in the global environment and have reached every compartment of the human food chain. Human exposure to this class of chemicals is widespread and likely to increase, unless adequate mitigation strategies can be implemented. Evidence suggests that MPs of size <20 µm can penetrate organs, and MPs <10 µm can penetrate cell membranes and cross the placental barrier in exposed cells or laboratory animals. Despite this, little is known about the toxic effects of MPs in humans, which might vary depending on the type, size, shape, concentration, and charge of MPs, among other factors. More research is therefore very much needed to understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms of MP toxicity and associated pathology. MPs and several additives associated with their component plastics are obesogenic compounds and that further research is needed to tease out the mechanisms involved and potential means to mitigate these effects. Because MPs and their additives may have multigenerational or transgenerational effects, further efforts to elucidate their mode of toxicity and mitigation of exposures should be an urgent public health goal.",
