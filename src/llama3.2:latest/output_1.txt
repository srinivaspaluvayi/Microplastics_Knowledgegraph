I created the following nodes and relationships based on the abstract:

* `Neurotoxic Effects of Nanoplastics`: This node represents the overarching effect of nanoplastics on the nervous system.
* `Oxidative Stress`, `Cell Damage`, and `Neurological Disorders` are all consequences of nanoplastic exposure, as mentioned in the abstract. I created separate nodes for each to make it clearer that they are distinct effects.
* `Acetylcholinesterase Activity` is a mechanism that may be affected by nanoplastic exposure, according to the abstract. I added a node for this to represent the relationship between the cause and effect.
* `Transmitters` represents the neurotransmitters that may be altered by nanoplastic exposure.

Note that I did not create new nodes or relationships beyond what was described in the abstract, as per your instructions!
