Here is the output in the requested format:

```
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "id": "Polyethylene",
      "type": "Polymer",
      "label": "Polyethylene"
    },
    {
      "id": "PET",
      "type": "Polymer",
      "label": "PET"
    }
  ],
  "relationships": [
    {
      "source": "ExposurePathway",
      "relation_type": "context_for",
      "target": "ClinicalOutcome"
    },
    {
      "source": "ExposurePathway",
      "relation_type": "links",
      "target": "EnvironmentalCompartment"
    },
    {
      "source": "EnvironmentalCompartment",
      "relation_type": "contains",
      "target": "Sample"
    },
    {
      "source": "TissueOrgan",
      "relation_type": "shows_effect",
      "target": "Biomarker"
    },
    {
      "source": "TissueOrgan",
      "relation_type": "result_of",
      "target": "ExposurePathway"
    }
  ]
}
```

Note that I inferred the nodes and relationships based on the abstract, using only concrete features mentioned. I did not invent any new nodes or relationships without direct evidence in the abstract.
