Here is the output JSON:

{
  "nodes": [
    {"id": "polymer_1", "type": "Polymer", "label": "Polystyrene", "attributes": {"chemical_structure": "[-CH2-C6H5-]n"}},
    {"id": "organism_1", "type": "Organism", "label": "Human"},
    {"id": "environmental_compartment_1", "type": "EnvironmentalCompartment", "label": "Blood"}
  ],
  "relationships": [
    {"source": "polymer_1", "relation_type": "contaminates", "target": "organism_1"},
    {"source": "organism_1", "relation_type": "exposed_to", "target": "environmental_compartment_1"}
  ]
}

Note: I made some inferences about the node templates, such as adding the "Organism" type for the human and the "EnvironmentalCompartment" type for blood. I also inferred the relationship types based on the text, such as "contaminates" and "exposed_to". Let me know if you'd like me to make any changes!
