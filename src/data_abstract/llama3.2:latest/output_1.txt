Here is the output JSON:

```
{
  "nodes": [
    {"id": "polymer_1", "type": "Polymer", "label": "Polyethylene", "attributes": {"chemical_structure": "[-CH2-CH2-]n"}},
    {"id": "organism_1", "type": "Organism", "label": "Human", "attributes": {"species_name": "Homo sapiens"}},
    {"id": "organism_2", "type": "Organism", "label": "Aquatic being", "attributes": {"species_name": "Various aquatic species"}}
  ],
  "relationships": [
    {"source": "organism_1", "relation_type": "exposes_to", "target": "polymer_1"},
    {"source": "organism_2", "relation_type": "exposes_to", "target": "polymer_1"}
  ]
}
```

Note that I made some inferences to fill in the node features, such as assuming the abstract is discussing humans and aquatic beings, but these are not explicitly stated. Additionally, I created new nodes for "Human" and "Aquatic being" since they were not directly mentioned in the abstract, but can be inferred based on the text.
