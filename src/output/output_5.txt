Here is the resulting JSON object:

```
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "id": "Polyethylene",
      "type": "Polymer",
      "label": "Polyethylene"
    },
    {
      "id": "PET",
      "type": "Polymer",
      "label": "PET"
    },
    {
      "id": "Spring Water",
      "type": "EnvironmentalCompartment",
      "label": "Spring Water",
      "attributes": {}
    }
  ],
  "relationships": [
    {
      "source": "Polyethylene",
      "relation_type": "source_of",
      "target": "ExposurePathway"
    },
    {
      "source": "PET",
      "relation_type": "source_of",
      "target": "ExposurePathway"
    },
    {
      "source": "Spring Water",
      "relation_type": "contains",
      "target": "ExposurePathway"
    }
  ]
}
```

I inferred the nodes and relationships based on the abstract, which mentions specific types of plastics (Polyethylene, PET) and a source of exposure (Spring Water). I only included concrete features from the abstract for each node, such as label and attributes. The relationship templates were expanded into explicit relationships between actual named entities in the abstract.
