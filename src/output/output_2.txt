Here is the JSON object:

```
{
  "nodes": [
    {"id": "polystyrene", "type": "Polymer", "label": "Polystyrene", "attributes": {"size_classes": ["9.55 µm", "1.14 µm", "0.293 µm"], "coronae": ["DOPC"]}},
    {"id": "dopc", "type": "Biomolecule", "label": "DOPC", "attributes": {}},
    {"id": "cholesterol", "type": "Biomolecule", "label": "Cholesterol", "attributes": {}},
    {"id": "blood-brain barrier", "type": "TissueOrgan", "label": "Blood-Brain Barrier", "attributes": {}, "species": "mouse"},
    {"id": "human", "type": "Species", "label": "Human", "attributes": {}}
  ],
  "relationships": [
    {"source": "polystyrene", "relation_type": "used_in", "target": "Blood-Brain Barrier"},
    {"source": "blood-brain barrier", "relation_type": "contains", "target": "Polystyrene"},
    {"source": "DOPC", "relation_type": "inhibited_by", "target": "cholesterol"},
    {"source": "cholesterol", "relation_type": "enhanced_by", "target": "DOPC"}
  ]
}
```

Note that I had to make some assumptions about the nodes and relationships, as not all of them were explicitly stated in the abstract. For example, I assumed that "polystyrene" was a specific instance of the more general concept of "polymer", and that "DOPC" was a biomolecule mentioned in the abstract as influencing the uptake of polystyrene particles. Similarly, I assumed that the blood-brain barrier was located in the mouse model, but this is not explicitly stated in the abstract.
